Google data analytics capstone project: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study! In this project, we will step into the shoes of a junior data analyst working at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic offers a wide range of bicycles, including traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it an inclusive option for people with disabilities and various rider preferences. The majority of Cyclistic users ride for leisure, while about 30% use the bikes for their daily commutes.

Our main objective is to support Cyclistic's marketing team in designing a new strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The company's success is closely tied to maximizing annual memberships, and we must provide data-driven insights and professional visualizations to back up our recommendations.

## Scenario

- **Cyclistic:** A bike-share program with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic is known for its inclusivity, offering various types of bikes, and serving both leisure and commuter riders.

- **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and our manager. Moreno is responsible for developing marketing campaigns and initiatives to promote Cyclistic's bike-share program.

- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** A group of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to guide Cyclistic's marketing strategy. We joined this team six months ago.

- **Cyclistic Executive Team:** The decision-makers who will approve our recommended marketing program.

## About the Company

Cyclistic launched its bike-share offering in 2016 and has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. Customers can unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other station in the system. Cyclistic's pricing plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members are Cyclistic's most profitable customers.

Cyclistic's finance analysts have highlighted the profitability of annual members, making it essential to focus on maximizing their numbers for future growth. Instead of targeting all-new customers, we aim to convert casual riders into annual members, leveraging the fact that casual riders are already aware of Cyclistic.

## Key Questions

We will address three key questions to guide our marketing program:

1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. **Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**
3. **How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

Let's dive into the data analysis process to find answers to these questions and provide valuable insights for Cyclistic's marketing strategy.
